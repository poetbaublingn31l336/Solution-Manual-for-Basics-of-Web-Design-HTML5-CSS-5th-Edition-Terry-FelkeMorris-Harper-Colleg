  * Basics of Web Design: HTML5, is a foundational introduction to beginning web design and web development. The text provides a balance of “hard” skills such as HTML 5, CSS, and “soft” skills such as web design and publishing to the Web, giving students a well-rounded foundation as they pursue careers as web professionals. Students will leave an introductory design course with the tools they need to build their skills in the fields of web design, web graphics, and web development.
 
  * The 5th Edition features a major change from previous edition. Although classic page layout methods using CSS float are still introduced, there is a new emphasis on Responsive Page Layout utilizing the new CSS Flexible Box Layout (Flexbox) and CSS Grid Layout techniques. Therefore, the new 5th Edition features new content, updated topics, hands-on practice exercises, and case studies.
